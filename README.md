# Habitable-Exoplanets
Created a data mining algorithm to search for potentially habitable exoplanets using the NASA Exoplanet Archive and the PHL Habitable Exoplanet Database.

Used Pandas and data mining/cleaning techniques to map out possible matches from the NASA Exoplanet Archive with confirmed habitable exoplanets from the PHL Database. Done under the supervision of Dr. Robert Downing in a team of researchers at ASDRP.
