# Habitable-Exoplanets
Created a data mining algorithm to search for potentially habitable exoplanets using the NASA Exoplanet Archive and the PHL Habitable Exoplanet Database.

Used Pandas and data mining/cleaning techniques to map out possible matches from the NASA Exoplanet Archive with confirmed habitable exoplanets from the PHL Database. Split the PHL database and the NASA database into star type by using K, M and G type stars. Then, we used important stellar and planetary attributes such as stellar luminosity, orbital eccentricity, and others highlighted in our research paper.

Done under the supervision of Dr. Robert Downing in a team of researchers at ASDRP. Created research paper showing our findings.
